From the Elton John album "Victim of Love," produced by 70s disco producer Pete Bellotte. Bellotte actually wrote all the tracks on this album (except one). This album is a rather strange one in Elton John's career, done at a time when he was exhausted from his mid-70s superstardom and taking a break from being the Elton John the world had come to know. Elton was not involved in any songwriting or playing on the album. He just showed up and sang the disco tracks which Bellotte created. Elton had been friends with Bellotte since the 60s and decided to do this album just after Bellotte had produced many disco hits with Donna Summer and others.
