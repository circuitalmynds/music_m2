If you are interested in purchasing digital download make sure to THUMBS UP! If I am prove a viable interest it would help my case to get this digital. I also have thought about this for Side A of a vinyl 12 single. Side B Spinners I'll Be Around. I think it would do really well. Anyway you can leave helpful comments. This thumbs up thing goes for everything on this channel. Big action means getting you closer to having your own vinyl  or digital music you love from an online service.  

It's been 40 years since when this was #1 on the Disco chart for 7 weeks starting the week ending November 25, up to December 30, 1978 when the combo of Le Freak", "Chic Cheer" and "I Want Your Love" ruled the clubs. A seriously funky disco song with a groove that never ends, it doesn't build and break like the anthemic "Le Freak" but  has this hypnotizing mix of polyrhythms that intoxicate, hypnotize and invigorate. 


I hope you like this new extended remix, I really enjoyed putting this one together...the fabulous and famous Chic string section open this sinuously sexy song  remix of want and need, something we can all relate to. I love the strings in this one, so beautifully produced and performed by three women who are Cheryl Hong, Karen Milne and Marianne Carroll. They played on every Chic project starting with 1978's "C'est Chic" all the way to "Real People" in 1980, Sheila & B Devotion's "Spacer" and on Johnny Mathis' stillborn Chic produced "I Love My Lady" that finally saw official release in 2019. 


The new style the boys used for Johnny Mathis was more subdued and perfect for the time, but Mathis' manager and label felt that it did not advance his career and that he was barely recognizable. I think that it would have been a hit, revitalizing Johnny's career and the remixes would have been out of this world had they gone ahead with the project back in 1980. Promo versions on vinyl made their way to some DJ's, notably Tee Scott who famously played some of the tracks on his radio show and then bootlegs were being passed around the internet for years. There even was a website that had some of the tracks uploaded so you could listen to them and they finally got all the tracks up there some time ago, a few years before the official release of a few songs from  "I Love My Lady" that made its appearance on  Nile Rodgers Presents The Chic Organization* - Box Set Vol. 1 / "Savoir Faire" in 2010. I for one would still love to hear the demo for "Le Freak" with all its expletive deleted glory.
